# HEAD M.A. Notes A Philosophy of Computer Art

## Notes:

- The doctrine of medium specificity, according to which each art form has a unique medium, has come under attack in recent years. 

- Digital art and computer art aren’t the same because they take advantage of different aspects of computer technology. A good way to appreciate the role computers play in computer art is to contrast it with the role they play in digital art. In digital art, this role is relatively obvious, though it requires a very short technical interlude

-Digital art involves computer-based encoding in a common digital code. A theory of digital art makes this explicit:

an item is a work of digital art just in case (1) it’s art (2) made by computer or (3) made for display by computer (4) in a common, digital code.

-Digital image-makers can reach niche audiences with diverse aesthetic expectations.

-Remediation is borrowing where “one medium is itself incorporated or represented in another medium.”1

-a kind is an appreciative art kind just in case we normally appreciate a work in the kind by comparison with arbitrarily any other works in that kind.

-Digital art is an art kind, but it’s not an appreciative art kind, and art forms are appreciative art kinds.

-Although the generic category of digital art isn’t an appreciative art kind, the more specific cate- gories of digital movies, digital photography, and digital music are appre- ciative art kinds.These aren’t art forms: they’re subcategories within the art forms of movies, images, and music.

-CAF: an item is a computer art work just in case (1) it’s art, (2) it’s run on a computer, (3) it’s interactive, and (4) it’s interactive because it’s run on a computer.

-Computer art works exploit the technology of computing in order to achieve interactivity.

-When images, text, sound, and traditional art media appear in computer art, they’re harnessed to achieve something not found in other art: interactivity.

-a work of art is interactive just in case it prescribes that the actions of its users help generate its display.

-a computer is any item that’s designed to run a computational process.

-In bronze sculpture, the model generates instances because it has some of the very same features that the instances should have; in music, the model generates performances because it tells performers how to sound them out. In computer art, displays are generated under the guidance of a computational process given user inputs. In computer art, the model is a computational process.

-Thus, one way to get at the identity of a work is to consider what sets it apart from copies or forgeries of it, assuming that we don’t appreciate a copy or forgery as we appreciate the original.1
