## NOTES Nicolas Nova:

- Define an angle (perhaps compare two apps that are approaching mindfulness/meditation within XR environments)?
- What is myndplay? 
- Where is the interactive part of mindfulness? How does it look like?
- Define mindfulness, what is the approach
- At some point you have to test what people lack for example when they use apps like "headspace"
- Stick to research topic
